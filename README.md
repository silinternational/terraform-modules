# End of Life

This repository is being phased out. Some of the modules have been moved to
their own repository, and others will be moved as changes become necessary.
The following is a list of the new module sources:

- [silinternational/alb/aws](https://github.com/silinternational/terraform-aws-alb) replaces aws/alb
- [silinternational/backup/aws](https://github.com/silinternational/terraform-aws-backup) replaces aws/backup/rds
- [silinternational/cloudtrail/aws](https://github.com/silinternational/terraform-aws-cloudtrail) replaces aws/cloudtrail
- [silinternational/ecs-service/aws](https://github.com/silinternational/terraform-aws-ecs-service) replaces aws/ecs/service-only
- [silinternational/vpc/aws](https://github.com/silinternational/terraform-aws-vpc) replaces aws/vpc

# Terraform Modules
This repository contains Terraform modules that implement conventions we use
on AWS and other providers. You're welcome to use them, however be aware
that they may not be the best available or suit your needs exactly right. We
have opinions and conventions we like to follow and these modules follow them.

## Documentation
Each module provides its own documentation, so browse the source to read more
about each.
